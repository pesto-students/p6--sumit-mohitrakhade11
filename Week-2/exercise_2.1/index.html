                     observed and even what you believe. That’s exciting because you’re wandering away from the things that you feel confident of, and you’re
                      wandering into a place where oh, <a href="https://www.rd.com/list/books-that-will-make-you-cry/">books that will make you cry.</a></p>

                <h2>NATASHA TRETHEWEY, THRALL</h2>
                <p class="para">If we can’t fully discern the motivations of the people in our immediate circles, the people in our own homes, can we expect to understand the nature of a “race” of people or the various circles that contain them—the family, the nation? This question guides the poems in Natasha Trethewey’s Thrall.<a href="https://www.rd.com/list/books-that-will-make-you-cry/">books that will make you cry.</a></p>

            <h2> CITIZEN: AN AMERICAN LYRIC
                (2014)</h2>
            <p class="para">You may recognize Claudia Rankine’s Citizen as the book—not just book of poetry, but book, full stop—that the Literary Hub staff voted most likely to endure in the literary canon of a decade from now. It is a special hybrid of a book, part poetry, part critical essay—the book won the 2014 National Book Critics Circle Award in Poetry.<a href="https://www.rd.com/list/books-that-will-make-you-cry/">books that will make you cry.</a></p>
